There are 2 html files and 2 css file adn 1 javascript file 

Index.html - this html file belongs to the home page which consist of structure of the system and the service. in the right botton side there are services mentione.
in the top left side there are several option but i have only enabled "contact us" as per the data given to us in the assighnment pdf.

Style.css - This is a styiling page which belong to the front part known as landing page index.html and all the desighn of index.html belongs to style.css.

Contact.html - this html file belong to the option present in the front page index.html where we can directly contact the backend department to know the query and resolve it 
here i have added 4 option 
1- name
2- phone number
3- email id
4- query 

user can easily understand and add their query as i kept it very simple because, there are my users who will use this website and those are unaware of recent technologies.

After successfull submission user will be shown a popuop where we will give a simple confirmation that "we will contact you soon".

Contact.css - all styles and background effect in contact.html are done by this styling page.

contact.js - as i have added popup i add some features so that if some user are done with the submission they can click "close" button so that they will redirect to the homepage and surf other products.

how to run?
its a basic html css and js code so we just have to open the file is vs code and live the project everything will fetch as per their code.

thanks.
